# üöÄ Mini Skill Tags UI Project

This is my first complete mini web development project where I worked with **both frontend and backend** (JSON data) to dynamically display skill tags in a responsive layout.

---

## üß† What I Learned

- How to **fetch data from a backend (JSON)** and use it in the frontend
- **JavaScript DOM manipulation** and dynamically generating UI elements
- Handling layout issues with **CSS Flexbox** and **manual width calculations**
- Creating a responsive tag system with a **`+N more` overflow feature**
- CSS trick: Used `-webkit-line-clamp` for text truncation

---

## üí° Project Features

- Reads user skill data from JSON
- Measures tag widths before rendering
- Dynamically shows as many tags as will fit in one line
- Adds a **`+N`** tag to indicate hidden overflow tags
- Clean, simple, responsive UI

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges I Faced

- Flexbox wrapping elements when I didn‚Äôt want it to
- `offsetWidth` didn‚Äôt work on elements not in the DOM
- Managing hidden measurement containers for width logic

---

## ‚úÖ How I Solved Them

- Created **temporary hidden DOM elements** to measure width accurately
- Used `classList.add()` and `.id` for clean DOM creation
- Dynamically adjusted visible tags and showed `+N more` for hidden ones
